  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Account` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `session_state` on the `Account` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `Account` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Session` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Session` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - You are about to drop the `User` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[google_id]` on the table `users` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Account` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Session` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Made the column `role_id` on table `users` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `is_active` on table `users` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `created_at` on table `users` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `updated_at` on table `users` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
